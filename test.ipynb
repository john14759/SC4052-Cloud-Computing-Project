The centralized cloud-based IoT service architecture has\\nserious limitations in terms of security, availability, and scalability, and is\\nsubject to single points of failure (SPOF). Recently, accommodating IoT\\nservices on blockchains has become a trend for better security, privacy, and\\nreliability. However, blockchain\\'s shortcomings of high cost, low throughput,\\nand long latency make it unsuitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we\\ntake a retrospection of existing blockchain-based IoT solutions and propose a\\nframework for efficient blockchain and IoT integration. Following the\\nframework, we design a novel blockchain-assisted decentralized IoT remote\\naccessing system, RS-IoT, which has the advantage of defending IoT devices\\nagainst zero-day attacks without relying on any trusted third-party. By\\nintroducing incentives and penalties enforced by smart contracts, our work\\nenables \"an economic approach\" to thwarting the majority of attackers who aim\\nto achieve monetary gains. Our work presents an example of how blockchain can\\nbe used to ensure the fairness of service trading in a decentralized\\nenvironment and punish misbehaviors objectively. We show the security of RS-IoT\\nvia detailed security analyses. Finally, we demonstrate its scalability,\\nefficiency, and usability through a proof-of-concept implementation on the\\nEthereum testnet blockchain.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-02-19\\nTitle: zk-IoT: Securing the Internet of Things with Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Blockchain Platforms\\nAuthors: Gholamreza Ramezan, Ehsan Meamari\\nSummary: This paper introduces the zk-IoT framework, a novel approach to enhancing the\\nsecurity of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems through the use of\\nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on blockchain platforms. Our framework ensures the\\nintegrity of firmware execution and data processing in potentially compromised\\nIoT devices. By leveraging the concept of ZKP, we establish a trust layer that\\nfacilitates secure, autonomous communication between IoT devices in\\nenvironments where devices may not inherently trust each other. The framework\\nincludes zk-Devices, which utilize functional commitment to generate proofs for\\nexecuted programs, and service contracts for encoding interaction logic among\\ndevices. It also utilizes a blockchain layer and a relayer as a ZKP storage and\\ndata communication protocol, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that\\nproof generation, reading, and verification take approximately 694, 5078, and\\n19 milliseconds in our system setup, respectively. These timings meet the\\npractical requirements for IoT device communication, demonstrating the\\nfeasibility and efficiency of our solution. The zk-IoT framework represents a\\nsignificant advancement in the realm of IoT security, paving the way for\\nreliable and scalable IoT networks across various applications, such as smart\\ncity infrastructures, healthcare systems, and industrial automation.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-03-03\\nTitle: Security and Privacy Enhancing in Blockchain-based IoT Environments via Anonym Auditing\\nAuthors: Peyman Khordadpour, Saeed Ahmadi\\nSummary: The integration of blockchain technology in Internet of Things (IoT)\\nenvironments is a revolutionary step towards ensuring robust security and\\nenhanced privacy. This paper delves into the unique challenges and solutions\\nassociated with securing blockchain-based IoT systems, with a specific focus on\\nanonymous auditing to reinforce privacy and security. We propose a novel\\nframework that combines the decentralized nature of blockchain with advanced\\nsecurity protocols tailored for IoT contexts. Central to our approach is the\\nimplementation of anonymization techniques in auditing processes, ensuring user\\nprivacy while maintaining the integrity and transparency of blockchain\\ntransactions. We outline the architecture of blockchain in IoT environments,\\nemphasizing the workflow and specific security mechanisms employed.\\nAdditionally, we introduce a security protocol that integrates\\nprivacy-enhancing tools and anonymous auditing methods, including the use of\\nadvanced cryptographic techniques for anonymity. This study also includes a\\ncomparative analysis of our proposed framework against existing models in the\\ndomain. Our work aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for enhancing\\nsecurity and privacy in blockchain-based IoT environments, paving the way for\\nmore secure and private digital ecosystems.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-03-11\\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence for Secured Information Systems in Smart Cities: Collaborative IoT Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Blockchain\\nAuthors: Amin Zakaie Far, Mohammad Zakaie Far, Sonia Gharibzadeh, Hajar Kazemi Naeini, Leila Amini, Shiva Zangeneh, Morteza Rahimi, Saeed Asadi\\nSummary: The accelerated expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised critical\\nchallenges associated with privacy, security, and data integrity, specifically\\nin infrastructures such as smart cities or smart manufacturing. Blockchain\\ntechnology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address\\nthese challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the\\nIoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper\\ninvestigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile\\ntransmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the\\nclustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of\\nDRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by\\nmaintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published\\nbetween 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered\\npractical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and\\nhighlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our\\ninvestigation shows how combining blockchain\\'s decentralized framework with DRL\\ncan address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission\\nefficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally,\\nwe explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications\\nof DRL technology. By addressing the challenges of machine learning and\\nblockchain integration, this study proposes novel perspectives for researchers\\nand serves as a foundational exploration from an interdisciplinary standpoint.\\n\\nPublished: 2020-05-01\\nTitle: On the Design of Co-operating Blockchains for IoT\\nAuthors: Gokhan Sagirlar, John D. Sheehan, Emanuele Ragnoli\\nSummary: Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a proper\\ndistributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes disadvantages of today\\'s\\ncentralized infrastructures, such as, among others, high cloud server\\nmaintenance costs, weakness for supporting time-critical IoT applications,\\nsecurity and trust issues. However, meeting requirements posed by IoT in\\nblockchain domain is not an easy endeavour. [1] proposes Hybrid-IoT, as a step\\ntowards decentralizing IoT with the help of blockchain technology. Hybrid-IoT\\nconsists of multiple PoW sub-blockchains to achieve distributed consensus among\\nIoT devices and an inter-connector framework, to execute transactions between\\nsub-blockchains. In this paper, we take the first step towards designing an\\ninter-connector for multiple blockchains for IoT that is specifically tailored\\nfor the Hybrid-IoT architecture. We also provide a detailed security\\ndiscussion, in order to identify threats and we provide discussion on how to\\ncope with threats.'"

      "Authors: Minfeng Qi, Ziyuan Wang, Qing-Long Han, Jinchao Zhang, Shiping Chen, Yang Xiang\n",
      "Abstract: To enable precision medicine and remote patient monitoring, internet of healthcare things (IoHT) has gained significant interest as a promising technique. With the widespread use of IoHT, nonetheless, privacy infringements such as IoHT data leakage have raised serious public concerns. On the other side, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have demonstrated great potential for enhancing trustworthiness and privacy protection for IoHT systems. In this survey, a holistic review of existing blockchain-based IoHT systems is conducted to indicate the feasibility of combining blockchain and IoHT in privacy protection. In addition, various types of privacy challenges in IoHT are identified by examining general data protection regulation (GDPR). More importantly, an associated study of cutting-edge privacy-preserving techniques for the identified IoHT privacy challenges is presented. Finally, several challenges in four promising research areas for blockchain-based IoHT systems are pointed out, with the intent of motivating researchers working in these fields to develop possible solutions.\n",

      "Authors: Mwaffaq Abu Alhija, Osama Al-Baik, Abdelrahman Hussein, H. Abdeljaber\n",
      "Abstract: The adoption of blockchain technology provides significant disruptive benefits to internet-of-things (IoT) applications in healthcare in vital aspects like security, integrity, transparency, and efficiency. Nevertheless, in order to fully realize the potential of blockchain-driven solutions, healthcare organizations have to address intricate compromises between essential factors including scalability, privacy and resource utilization considering that the data sensitivity alongside strict regulatory compliance requirements characterize this sector. This research discusses the fundamental aspects of these trade-offs, including the range of consensus protocols (e.g. proof-of-work, proof-of-stake) and cryptographic techniques (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption). A systematic choice matrix is created, which relates specific use cases of the healthcare IoT to the optimal tailored blockchain structures on such critical metrics as transaction volume, frequency, privacy level and resource restrictions. The suggested framework provides solid, actionable recommendations to healthcare organizations in order to help them benefit from the enormous promise of the blockchain for connected IoT healthcare by finding a balance between decentralization advantages and performance, security and compliance requirements.\n",
